# data_analyze_with_ml
this is a machine learning project
# how deas it work
1. with pandas we read the .csv file
2. with pandas we clean and preper the data for use
3. we use the the model DecisionTreeClassifier from the sklearn.tree to make a machine learning model with the data from thhe .csv file
4. we save the model in a .joblib file
5. now we can just load the model from the .joblib file and dont need steps 1, 2, 3, and 4
6. we make a prediction with the machine learning model
